				<key>chairImage0</key>
				<string>We must adjust the chair to the proper height by using lever 1 as shown in the picture. The height of the chair should be at an appropriate level so that your thighs are parallel to the floor as well as your feet flat on the ground.</string>
			</dict>
			<dict>
				<key>chairImage1</key>
				<string>If possible, the seat depth should be adjusted as well. It should be close enough to the backrest so that you can use its support and also leave 2 to 3 fingers’ space between the edge of the seat and the back of your knee.</string>
			</dict>
			<dict>
				<key>chairImage2</key>
				<string>The backrest height should be adjusted so that its support fits the natural curve of your lumbar spine. Always try to remember to sit all the way back in your seat to use the support! Try not to sit on the edge of the seat while at your desk.</string>

				<key>keyboardTrayImage2</key>
				<string>If the keyboard and mouse are located on the desk surface, adjust the chair height until your arms are parallel to the floor and your wrists are straight. You may require a footrest to support your legs and feet if they are no longer supported by the floor.</string>
			</dict>
			<dict>
				<key>keyboardTrayImage3</key>
				<string>Avoid resting your wrists while typing. Only use wrist supports during rest periods. If possible, remove your hands from the keyboard entirely to promote micro-breaks. Make sure to place the support under your palms and not your wrists.</string>

			<dict>
				<key>monitorImage4</key>
				<string>Most CRT (old style) monitors are not height adjustable however the height can be raised using a riser or CPU. Alternatively, if the monitor is already on top of a CPU and is too high, lower the monitor to the desk surface to reduce the height.</string>
