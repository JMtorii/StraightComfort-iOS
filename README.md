=======================
Whether at work or at home, chances are you spend a lot of day on the computer sitting down for what could be hours at a time.  You might notice at the end of the day you experience things like little pain in the neck, tightness in the back, or discomfort in your shoulders.  What many people don't realize is that while these minor annoyances may not seem like a big deal, over time they can progress and get to the point where they can cause a lot of pain and might not be reversible.

## Our Goal
The purpose of StraightComfort is to allow anybody to properly manange and set up their workstation according to their needs.  We want to ensure that people are educated and aware of the risks of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) and how to prevent them.  

## Preventing MSDs
Our main goal of preventing MSDs is achieved by speficially tailoring the workstation to suit individual needs and by following recommended Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Ergonomic guidelines.  Each instruction in the StraightComfort app addresses major MSD risk factors such as loads, posture, duration, and repetition.
